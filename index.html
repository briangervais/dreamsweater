       <h5>Colorado Springs, CO</h5>

       <p>Colorado Springs is for people who love adventure, who seek community, and and who seek economic opportunity.  It is a place of tollerance and diversity, a place for people who are lovers and dreamers, for people who are musicians and political activists.</p>
       <p>In the past Colorado Springs was thought of as a place for fundamentalist Christians and the military.  While members of the military are a significant part of our community, hate and intollerence are not welcome here.</p>
       <p><em>Colorado Springs is rebranding.</em></p>
       
       <h5Colorado Springs is becoming more Liberal</h5>
       <p>Aligning our values closely with our close neighbor Manitou Springs and our sister cities Denver and Boulder, Colorado Springs seeks to promote peace and prosperity across the front range of the Rocky Mountains.</p>
       
       <h5>Colorado Springs loves Dogs</h5>
       <p>Just check out Bear Creek Dog Park sometime.  This Eden for canines will fill your dog, Waldo, with a demonic sense of pleasure.  He will find so many special goles to mark with his pee.  He will smell and flirt and brawl with so many other smelly, flirty, brawling dogs.  Truly, he will have found paradise here.</p>

<h5>Colorado Springs is a place for Coffee</h5>
<p>Yes, just head on down to Carnelian Coffee in Old Colorado City, just West of Downton before you get to Manitou Springs.  Get hyped on a pour-over before heading to the Maniou Springs arcade.  Stay in an AirBnb and walk to Pizza Rustica for a delicious wood-oven-fired pizza with craft beer and salad.</p>

<h5>More than anything else, try the weed.  Colorado Springs just legalized it.  Yes, we were late to the program, but you can not enjoy marijuana either for medical purposes or recreationally.  Colorado Springs farmers are even growing hemp for CBD oil-extraction and possible other commerial applications like paper, pulp, rope, and fabric manufacturing.</p>
